## How to Analyze the Glyph Problem Network Without Violating the Protocol

**Status:** Frozen  
**Version:** 1.0

- GPN Edge Model v1.0  
- GPN Feature Set v1.0

## 1. Purpose

This document defines **how analytical, statistical and AI-based methods may be applied to the Glyph Problem Network (GPN)** without violating the epistemological, semantic and ethical boundaries of the GLYPH Protocol.

The goal is to:
- Enable rigorous analysis
- Preserve problem integrity
- Prevent solution contamination
- Protect human cognitive agency

---

## 2. Fundamental Principle

> The GPN analyzes **structures of problems**, not **answers to problems**.

Any analytical method that attempts to:
- rank solutions,
- prescribe actions,
- decide priorities,
- optimize interventions

**violates the GLYPH Protocol.**

---

## 3. What GPN Analytics IS Allowed to Do

GPN analytics may be used to:

- Identify patterns across problems
- Detect structural similarities
- Highlight recurring configurations
- Reveal systemic concentrations
- Support human sensemaking
- Enable comparative learning

GPN analytics is **descriptive and exploratory**, never prescriptive.

---

## 4. What GPN Analytics MUST NOT Do

GPN analytics must NOT:

- Select leverage points
- Decide which problem is “more important”
- Recommend solutions
- Replace human validation
- Generate action plans
- Produce automated decisions

Analytics informs thinking — it does not think for you.

---

## 5. Allowed Analytical Families

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

**Purpose:** Understand distribution and frequency.

Allowed examples:
- Number of GLYPHs per system
- Frequency of impact types
- Distribution of causal chain lengths

Not allowed:
- Statistical ranking of problems by urgency or value

---

### 5.2 Similarity Analysis

**Purpose:** Identify structurally similar problems.

Allowed methods:
- Cosine similarity
- Jaccard similarity
- Feature overlap analysis

Use cases:
- “Problems with similar variable profiles”
- “GLYPHs sharing causal depth patterns”

---

### 5.3 Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)

**Purpose:** Reveal natural groupings.

Allowed methods:
- K-means
- Hierarchical clustering
- DBSCAN

Rules:
- Clusters describe similarity, not priority
- Clusters must be explainable in GLYPH terms

---

### 5.4 Factor Analysis

**Purpose:** Reduce dimensionality and expose latent structures.

Allowed use:
- Identify latent dimensions (e.g., governance-heavy vs structure-heavy problems)

Forbidden use:
- Interpreting factors as “root causes”
- Naming factors as solutions

---

### 5.5 Network Analysis (SNA-Inspired)

**Purpose:** Understand problem interconnectivity.

Allowed metrics:
- Degree
- Betweenness
- Centrality
- Clustering coefficient

Allowed interpretations:
- “This GLYPH mediates multiple problem domains”
- “This structure recurs across systems”

Not allowed:
- “This is the most critical problem to fix”

---

## 6. Interpretation Safeguards

Every analytical result must pass the following checks:

| Question | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Does this suggest a solution? | Must be NO |
| Does this remove human judgment? | Must be NO |
| Does this redefine the problem? | Must be NO |
| Does this add clarity? | Must be YES |
| Is it explainable in GLYPH terms? | Must be YES |

If any answer violates these rules, the analysis is invalid.

---

## 7. Human-in-the-Loop Requirement

All analytical outputs require:

- Human interpretation
- Contextual validation
- Explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty

No analytical result is considered valid until reviewed by a human GLYPH practitioner.

---

## 8. AI-Assisted Analysis Guidelines

AI systems may:

- Extract features
- Detect patterns
- Suggest similarities
- Flag anomalies
- Visualize networks

AI systems may NOT:

- Decide meaning
- Select leverage points
- Rank importance
- Generate solutions
- Replace validation

AI assists cognition — it does not own it.

---

## 9. Probabilistic Modeling Constraints

Probabilities may be used to express:

- Likelihood of similarity
- Confidence in relationships
- Recurrence tendencies

Probabilities must NEVER express:
- Truth
- Priority
- Decision authority

All probabilities must be explicitly labeled as **supporting signals**, not conclusions.

---

## 10. Visualization Rules

Allowed visualizations:
- Network graphs
- Heatmaps
- Feature distributions
- Cluster maps

Forbidden visualizations:
- Dashboards labeled “Top Problems”
- Rankings by urgency or ROI
- Automated recommendation panels

---

## 11. Validation of Analytical Outputs

Each analysis must document:

- Data used
- Features selected
- Method applied
- Known limitations
- Human interpretation notes

This documentation becomes part of the GPN audit trail.

---

## 12. Ethical Boundary

The GPN exists to:
- Improve thinking
- Reduce cognitive bias
- Support inclusive reasoning

It must never become:
- A decision authority
- A control mechanism
- A justification engine
- A replacement for human responsibility

---

## 13. Final Statement

> The power of the GPN lies not in answering questions, but in revealing how problems relate, repeat and resonate across systems.

Analysis is a lens — not a verdict.
