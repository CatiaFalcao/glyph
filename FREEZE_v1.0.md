**Project:** GLYPH — Universal Language for Problem Formulation

## 1. Purpose of This Declaration

This document formally declares the **freeze** of version **v1.0.0** of the GLYPH framework.

The purpose of this freeze is to:
- Establish a **stable canonical reference** for GLYPH
- Preserve authorship, structure, and semantic integrity
- Enable academic citation, institutional adoption, and public reference
- Prevent retroactive modifications to the foundational version

---

## 2. Scope of the Freeze

The freeze applies to all artifacts explicitly associated with **GLYPH v1.0.0**, including but not limited to:

- GLYPH Core Protocol v1.0  
- How to Think in GLYPH — Official PDF v1.0  
- GLYPH Dataset v1 (Nodes)  
- GPN Specification v1  
- Official diagrams and schemas  
- Validation rules, canonical structures, and definitions  
- All documentation included in Release v1.0.0  

These artifacts together constitute the **canonical definition** of GLYPH v1.0.

## 3. Meaning of “Frozen”

A frozen version means:

- ❌ No structural changes will be made to v1.0.0  
- ❌ No semantic reinterpretation will be applied retroactively  
- ❌ No modifications to field order, definitions, or rules  

- ✅ v1.0.0 remains permanently accessible  
- ✅ v1.0.0 can be cited, referenced, and taught  
- ✅ v1.0.0 serves as the baseline for all future versions  

Any future evolution of GLYPH will occur **only through new versions** (e.g., v1.1, v2.0).

---

## 4. Versioning Policy After Freeze

Following this freeze:

- **Minor versions (v1.x)** may introduce clarifications, extensions, or additional materials  
- **Major versions (v2.0+)** may introduce structural or conceptual changes  

However:
> No future version will invalidate, overwrite, or redefine GLYPH v1.0.0.

---

## 5. Authorship and Precedence

This declaration affirms that:

- GLYPH v1.0.0 was originally conceived, structured, and documented by **Catia Falcão**
- Public publication, versioning, and release records establish clear **precedence**
- All future references to GLYPH must acknowledge this origin

---

## 6. Legal and Licensing Context

GLYPH v1.0.0 is released under the license defined in [`LICENSE.md`](./LICENSE.md).

This freeze declaration does not alter licensing terms but reinforces:
- Authorship
- Canonical scope
- Version immutability

---

## 7. Statement of Finality

With this declaration:

> **GLYPH v1.0.0 is officially frozen.**

It represents the first complete, stable, and public formulation of GLYPH as a universal language for problem formulation.

All future work builds **on top of this foundation**, never in place of it.
