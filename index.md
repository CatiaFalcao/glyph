# GLYPH

**GLYPH** is a universal language for structured problem formulation.

It exists to help humans — and systems — describe problems clearly *before* attempting to solve them.

> **Intelligence starts with the right problem.**

## What GLYPH Is

GLYPH is a **problem formulation framework**, not a solution method.

It provides:
- A canonical structure to describe real problems
- A shared language independent of domain or culture
- A validation framework to reduce ambiguity and bias
- A cognitive aid for both neurotypical and neurodivergent thinkers

GLYPH focuses on **clarity before action**.

---

## What GLYPH Is Not

- It is not a solution generator
- It is not an AI decision-maker
- It is not a management methodology
- It does not replace human judgment

GLYPH structures thinking. Humans decide.
