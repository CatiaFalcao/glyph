# GLYPH — Quick Guide (External Use)

## What is GLYPH?
GLYPH is a universal language for formulating problems before solutions.
It helps clarify *what the problem really is*, independently of domain, culture, or role.

## What GLYPH is NOT
- It is not a solution
- It is not a diagnosis
- It is not a decision-making tool
- It does not think for you

## How to Think in GLYPH (Very Short)
1. First, identify **where** the problem exists (System)
2. Then describe **under what conditions** it appears (Context)
3. Observe **what happens** repeatedly (Symptom)
4. Identify **who or what is affected** (Impact)
5. List **elements present** (Variables)
6. Connect them logically (Causal Chain)
7. Choose **one leverage point**
8. Define **how to know it improved** (Success Criteria)

## How long does it take?
- 20–40 minutes on average
- You do not need to read all GLYPH documentation

## What is expected from you?
- Use the template once
- Apply it to a real problem you know
- Return the filled document

That’s all.

Thank you for contributing to the validation of GLYPH.
