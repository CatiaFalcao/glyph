# GLYPH — Roadmap

This document outlines the **planned evolution of GLYPH** following the official freeze of version **v1.0.0**.

The roadmap exists to:
- Provide transparency about future directions
- Protect the canonical integrity of the framework
- Avoid speculative or unofficial interpretations
- Signal long-term intent without committing to premature details

---

## 🔒 Canonical Baseline

**GLYPH v1.0.0** is frozen and serves as the **permanent foundation** of the framework.

Nothing in this roadmap will:
- Modify the canonical structure of v1.0.0
- Redefine existing concepts or rules
- Apply retroactive changes to frozen artifacts

All evolution occurs **on top of** the v1.0 baseline.

See: `FREEZE_v1.0.md`

## ✅ Version 1.0 — Foundation (Completed)

**Status:** Released & Frozen  
**Scope:** Canonical definition

Delivered:
- GLYPH Core Protocol v1.0
- How to Think in GLYPH — Official Guide v1.0 (PDF)
- GPN Specification v1
- GLYPH Dataset v1
- Official diagrams and schemas
- Licensing, governance, and freeze declaration
- GitHub Pages (public reference)

This version establishes GLYPH as a **complete, usable, and citable framework**.

---

## 🟡 Version 1.1 — Clarification & Adoption Support (Planned)

**Status:** Planned  
**Nature:** Non-breaking

Possible focus areas:
- Clarifications of existing definitions (no structural change)
- Additional examples and case illustrations
- Expanded neuroinclusive guidance
- Improved navigation and cross-referencing of documentation
- Minor editorial refinements

Constraints:
- No new mandatory fields
- No change in canonical order
- No reinterpretation of leverage, causality, or validation rules

---

## 🟡 Version 1.2 — Tooling & Validation Aids (Exploratory)

**Status:** Exploratory  
**Nature:** Optional extensions

Possible directions:
- Validation checklists and visual aids
- Templates for manual GLYPH formulation
- Assisted (not automated) tooling concepts
- Educational material for workshops or academic use

Constraints:
- GLYPH remains human-led
- No automated decision-making
- Tools support cognition, not substitution

---

## 🟠 Version 2.0 — Extensions (Future, Not Committed)

**Status:** Conceptual  
**Nature:** Potential breaking changes

Possible exploration areas:
- New system types (subject to protocol governance)
- Extended network models beyond GPN v1
- Formal interoperability with analytical tools
- Explicit AI-assistance boundaries (if applicable)

Important:
- v2.0 will only be considered after significant real-world adoption of v1.x
- Any breaking change will follow a formal proposal and review process
- v1.0 remains valid and citable indefinitely

---

## 🚫 Explicitly Out of Scope (Current Roadmap)

The following are **not planned** at this stage:

- Certification programs
- Commercial licensing models
- Proprietary software products
- Closed-source versions
- AI agents making autonomous decisions

These may be revisited in the future, but are intentionally excluded now.

---

## 🧭 Governance of the Roadmap

This roadmap:
- Is indicative, not contractual
- May evolve in wording, not in intent
- Does not override the Core Protocol or Freeze Declaration

Final decisions regarding GLYPH evolution remain with the author and follow documented governance rules.

---

## 📌 Closing Note

GLYPH is designed to evolve **slowly, deliberately, and transparently**.

Stability, clarity, and integrity take precedence over speed or expansion.
