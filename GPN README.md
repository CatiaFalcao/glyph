# Glyph Problem Network (GPN)

**Version:** v1.0  
**Status:** Frozen  
**Related Protocol:** GLYPH Core Protocol v1.0  

---

## 1. What is the GPN?

The **Glyph Problem Network (GPN)** is a network-based model designed to operate on top of the **GLYPH Protocol**, enabling the analysis of relationships between formally structured problems.

While the GLYPH Protocol defines a **canonical language for problem formulation**, the GPN provides the structural and analytical layer that allows multiple GLYPHs to be connected, correlated and analyzed as a system.

In the GPN:
- **Nodes represent GLYPHs** (fully structured problems)
- **Edges represent meaningful relationships** between problems
- **The network reveals systemic patterns**, not isolated issues

The GPN does not solve problems.  
It reveals how problems relate to each other.

---

## 2. Why the GPN exists

Organizations and complex systems rarely fail due to isolated problems.  
They fail because **interconnected problems are treated independently**.

The GPN exists to address limitations such as:
- Repeated analysis of similar problems across domains
- Lack of visibility of shared variables and impacts
- Fragmented decision-making across silos
- Difficulty prioritizing problems systemically
- Misuse of data and AI due to poorly framed problems

By structuring problems first (GLYPH) and then connecting them (GPN), the network enables **systemic awareness before decision-making**.

## 3. Relationship between GLYPH and GPN

| Layer | Role |
|------|------|
| **GLYPH Protocol** | Formal language for structuring individual problems |
| **GPN** | Network model for relating multiple structured problems |

**Important principle:**  
> A GPN can only exist if its nodes are valid GLYPHs.

Unstructured problems, narratives or partial descriptions are not allowed as nodes.

---

## 4. Core Concepts

### 4.1 Nodes

- Each node in the GPN represents a **validated GLYPH**
- Nodes are immutable once frozen
- Nodes retain their original domain (organizational, industrial, human, environmental, digital)

### 4.2 Edges

Edges represent **explicit relationships** between GLYPHs.  
They are directional or non-directional depending on the relationship type.

Common edge types include:
- **Shared Variable**
- **Shared Impact**
- **Causal Dependency**
- **Structural Similarity**
- **Temporal Recurrence**

Edges do not imply causation unless explicitly defined.

---

## 5. Network Purpose

The GPN enables:
- Identification of recurring problem patterns
- Cross-domain learning
- Systemic prioritization
- Preparation for advanced analytics
- Responsible use of AI and automation

The network does not replace human reasoning.  
It augments human cognition by making structural relationships visible.

---

## 6. Analytical Foundations

The GPN is conceptually inspired by:
- Social Network Analysis (SNA)
- Graph theory
- Systems thinking
- Factor analysis and clustering (future layers)

However, the GPN is **problem-centric**, not actor-centric or data-centric.

---

## 7. Scope and Limitations

The GPN:
- Does **not** generate solutions
- Does **not** rank problems by urgency alone
- Does **not** automate decisions

The GPN:
- Structures relationships
- Enables insight
- Supports better human judgment

## 9. Versioning and Governance

- All GPN documents follow strict versioning
- Changes require explicit version updates
- Frozen versions are immutable
- The GPN follows the governance principles defined by the GLYPH Protocol

---

## 10. Status

The GPN v1.0 is published as a **conceptual and structural specification**.

Implementation layers (analytics, visualization, automation) are intentionally decoupled and will evolve in future versions.

---

## 11. Final Principle

> The quality of decisions in complex systems depends less on intelligence and more on the quality of the problems being connected.

The GPN exists to make those connections explicit.
